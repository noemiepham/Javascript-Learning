## Finding HTML Elements

Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

-   Finding HTML elements by id 
> const element = document.getElementById("intro");

-   Finding HTML elements by tag name
> const element = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
-   Finding HTML elements by class name
> const x = document.getElementsByClassName("intro");
-   Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
> const x = document.querySelectorAll("p.intro");
-   Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections
